{NOTE: API :- Application programming Interface:- using login feature of somother company by giving it api key..
              suppose we are using login feature in our application of googals and googal is asking api key for tracking and security perpose }
ex:- when you install swiggy , it will ask sign up, login with googal and login with facebook..so swiggy is using login feature of googal and facebook by providing them api key..
