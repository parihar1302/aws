VPC Peering:- It helps you to connect 2 different VPCs with each other. It's a bidirectional connectivity. In that, both VPC work like one large VPC/network & instances can communicate with each other through private ipv4 & ipv6. It doesn't require Public IP address to connect with another instance.
============= VPC Peering can be done in Same Region, Cross/Multi Region & Cross/Multi AWS Account.
              You can connect another instance through Private IP, since it's Intranet(A Large one network)
              If traffic flows in peering connection than only you will be charged.
              One vpc needs to send request, where other has to accsept it.
              

Note:- During the VPC peering, you need to make sure that CIDR range & Subnet IP range should not be same or duplicate.

Ex:- VPC A CIRD :- 10.0.0.0/16                       VPC B CIRD :- 10.1.0.0/16
           Subnet:- 10.0.1.0/24                            Subnet:- 10.1.1.0/24
