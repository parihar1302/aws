###aws elastic bean stack


# it is a plateform as a service used for deploying and scaling the web application which written in java,.net,python,php and node.js etc serverlike:-apache,tomcat,nginx 

# simplest and fastest way to deploy an aws application 

# plateform as a service means =its a cloudcomputing service where u can deploy and host your application.

# ebs provide health check of the web server environment appication. 
  healthchek:- grey= environment updating, green=healthchek successful,yellow=2 or more chewcks failed red=3 or more cheksfailed

# means we just have to worry about code, rest resources(ec2,elb,asg,s3 & vpc etc) will be handeled by platform as a service (here EBS)

# if u laucnch an application on ebs and later u want to add somthing so u can do widout deleting the previos version. so u will have v1 and v2 both.

# note {at a single point of time environment can run only single version application but in ebs u can create multi environment for single application in different         stage (prod, developemnt, testing)ex.-
        ex.- for production 1st environment withj 1 version , for development 2nd environment with version 2 for test 3rd environment with v3}



features

1.) quiker deployment :- focus on code only rest will be handeled by EBS cuzz its a plateform as a service. so deploymnt will be fast

2.a) simplifing operation:- simple task is code rest will no have to worry

3.) cost efficient:- widout ebs have to deployment other 3rd party software for monitoring or other perpose\ full costly
                     wid ebs all all dependent tool will be in a package so no additional cost.

4.) multi-tanat architure:- can be used in any device.

5.) better user experince:- can see the clear view and detail of production , testing or development stage.



# two type of tier

a.) web server tier:- server http request . elb > ec2 > host manage

b.) worker tier :- process background task.like time insentive and resource consuming task
                   ex.- if 1 user send some big request  to web server , web server except and process in the background  and take time cuzz request is big meanwhile                         2nd user send request to web server due to web server already proceesing user 1 request it will deny user 2 request. for outcome we add worker                         tier after web server so which ever request comes worker tier will handel it.
           

    user > web server > SQS > worker environment (deamon) > application
